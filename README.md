This repository contains a complete mini–data‑warehouse and business
intelligence project built on top of the public
[Banking-Dataset](https://github.com/ahsan084/Banking-Dataset) by Ahmed Ahsan.

The goal is to demonstrate how raw CSV files can be transformed into a
relational schema and then analyzed through an interactive Power BI dashboard
for banking transactions and customer data.

---

## Project Overview

The project is composed of three main parts:

1. **Python ETL script (`etl/ETL.py`)**  
   - Reads the original CSV files from the public banking dataset.  
   - Cleans and normalizes the data.  
   - Loads the result into a **relational Excel workbook** with separate
     sheets for dimensions and fact tables.

2. **Relational data model (`data/`)**  
   - Excel file generated by the ETL step (e.g. `banking-relational.xlsx`).  
   - Contains the following tables:

     - `DimCustomer` – customer attributes (name, address, city, age, gender, …)  
     - `DimAccount` – account attributes (account type, balance, opening date, branch, customer key, …)  
     - `FactTransactions` – detailed transactions per account (date, amount, type, balance after transaction, …)  
     - `Loans` – loan contracts (amount, status, approval date, branch, customer key, …)  
     - `Cards` – card products by customer (card type, credit limit, balance, …)  
     - `FactFeedback` – customer feedback records (type, resolution status, date, …)  
     - `FactAnomalies` – anomalies or suspected fraud events by customer  
     - `Branches` – bank branches / locations

3. **Power BI dashboard (`powerbi/banking-dashboard.pbix`)**  
   - Imports the relational Excel file.  
   - Rebuilds the star‑schema relationships between the tables.  
   - Provides an interactive dashboard for **banking transactions and customer
     data**.

## Power BI Dashboard

The main report page is titled **“Banking transactions and customer data
Dashboard”** and includes:

- **KPI cards**
  - Average account balance  
  - Number of active accounts  
  - (Optionally) total transaction amount and total loan exposure

- **Pie / donut charts**
  - Distribution of feedback by type (Suggestion / Complaint / Praise)  
  - Distribution of card products (MasterCard / AMEX / Visa)

- **Bar charts**
  - Average transaction indicator by transaction type (Transfer, Deposit,
    Withdrawal)  
  - Number of customers by city

- **Time‑series chart**
  - Sum of transaction amounts and loan amounts by transaction month (using
    converted serial dates)

- **Detailed account table**
  - Customer name, AccountID and sum of account balance, with a total at the
    bottom

- **Summary comparison chart**
  - Loans count, transactions count, feedback count and anomalies count  
  - Total loan amount vs total transaction amount

All visuals share the same filters, so selecting a city, period or product
type automatically updates the entire page.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (for the ETL)
  - `pandas`
  - `openpyxl`
- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop** (for the dashboard)

### 1. Run the ETL

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python dependencies (for example):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

3. Download the original banking dataset from  
   [Banking-Dataset: Comprehensive Banking Database](https://github.com/ahsan084/Banking-Dataset)
   (or place the CSV files where `ETL.py` expects them).
4. Run the ETL script:

   ```bash
   python etl/ETL.py
   ```

5. The script generates a relational Excel file in the `data/` folder
   (e.g. `banking-relational.xlsx`).

### 2. Open the Power BI report

1. Open `powerbi/banking-dashboard.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. If necessary, update the path of the Excel data source to point to your
   local `data/banking-relational.xlsx`.
3. Refresh the report (`Home` → `Refresh`) to load the latest data.

## Reuse and Academic Context

This project was developed as part of an academic thesis on **Big Data and
business intelligence for banking transactions and customer data**.

All artefacts of the project, including:

- the Python ETL script,
- the relational Excel file,
- and the Power BI `.pbix` dashboard,
